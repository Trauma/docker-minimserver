# docker-minimserver

# Introduction

MinimServer is a new UPnP AV music server with a number of innovative features that make it easier to organize and explore your music collection. If you have a network music player that supports the UPnP AV standards (see this page), you'll get much more from your music collection if you're using MinimServer as your music server software.
